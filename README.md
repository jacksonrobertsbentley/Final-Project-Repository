# Final-Project-Repository
 
In this project, I was able to determine if my fantasy football team was unlucky or not over this current season. I simulated a season 100 times to find that my team was far and away the most unlucky team in the league. In the dashboard, graphs can be seen comparing each team's point totals, simulated seasons, and win totals. A report is also included with a more detailed description of my results.
